## 📊 Project Overview

This project contains three distinct machine learning analyses:

1. **Match Outcome Prediction** (Classification) - Predicting win/lose/draw results using team statistics and historical data
2. **Expected Goals Analysis** (Regression) - Analyzing team performance against expected goals metrics
3. **Team Strength Clustering** (Unsupervised Learning) - Grouping teams into tiers based on performance attributes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming:** Python 3.9
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

📈 Key Insights
Team Performance Patterns: Identified consistent overperformers and underperformers based on expected vs. actual goals

Match Predictors: Discovered key features that most influence match outcomes (e.g., possession, shots on target)

League Structure: Revealed natural clustering of teams into distinct tiers (top contenders, mid-table, relegation candidates)

🎯 Business Impact
This analysis provides actionable insights for:

Football Clubs: Scout opposition strengths and weaknesses

Sports Analysts: Understand key performance indicators

Betting Companies: Build more accurate prediction models

Fans & Media: Gain deeper understanding of team dynamics

📝 Dataset
Source: LaLiga Matches Dataset 2019-2025 (FBref)

The dataset contains comprehensive match statistics including possession, shots, passes, and expected goals (xG) metrics.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Incorporate real-time data feeds and live predictions

Add advanced deep learning models (LSTM, Transformers)

Develop interactive dashboard for visualization

Include player-level statistics and injury data
